# Train-Scheduler

## Overview

This project is a Train Scheduler. It allows a user to enter a Train Name, Destination, Train Time, and Frequency of Arrival. The inputs will then post to the Train Information container, calculate the nest arrival time, and also send the data over to Firebase. The minutes to arrival will update every minute based off of the current time.
